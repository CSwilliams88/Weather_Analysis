WeatherPy
In this example, I'll be creating a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.

VacationPy
In this example, I'll be using the data collected from WeatherPy along with jupyter-gmaps and Google APIs to plan future vacation locations. Morever hotels to stay at during these vacations.
