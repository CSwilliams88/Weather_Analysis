WeatherPy
Some trends that can be seen given the information found is:
  1. The most noticeable thing is that you can see the max temp is directly impacted by location (coordinates).
  2. Also you can notice on the temp scatter plot where the equator is located or close to it by seeing where the max temp peaks.
  3. I found interesting that the normal humidity from this list is 60-80%.
